NoiseAlert

A "noise activated dialer" application. Uses a media-recorder to listen on
microphone and periodically query the volume level. If a configured threshold
is exceeded a pre-configured number is called.

The application has a main activity with a custom view object representing
a graphical sound volume display and a canned preferences activity. All user
interactions are triggered through the menu:

Start/Stop: start or stop monitoring
Test: activate monitoring without calling alert number to help calibrate
  noise threshold.
Panic: dial alert number immediately
Settings: Bring up preferences screen with the following settings:

Alert Phone Number: number to be called if threshold is exceeded or Panic
  menu item is selected.
Sound Threshold: Noise level threshold from 1-9
Sleep Interval: optional sleep time in between periods of active monitoring 
  (to save power)
Enable Graphics: enable/disable graphical sound volume display (to save power)
